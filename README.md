Hello everyone,

My name is Ahmad Murey (أحمد مرعي)

I started programing since 1994 on a MSX1 second-hand machine which was the only affordable one for me and my brother back then, me with my brother wrote a lot of BASIC programs for all sort of uses we can think of.

- My previous interests were QBasic, VB6 and AS1/AS2 using SWiSH Max Flash authoring tool.
- My current interests are VB.Net, C#, MSSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScrip, PHP, MySql/MariaDB.
- Also I like working on [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/) 3D modeling although I'm not a designer but I can use the tool to build 3D model if I have the correct measurements
- I decided to learn more about GitHub and get the most out of it although with all current restrictions applied to my country
